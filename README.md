# NeoVax
Personalize medicine has helped researchers and doctors across the world provide targeted therapies to treat specific cancer cells. NeoVax is a personalized vaccine that researchers discovered has a long lasting positive anti-tumor responses to patients with specific cancer types. The data gather from this research is very large and has been occuring for a few years now. As a Technical Product Manager II at large research hospital for cancer patients in Massachusetts, I worked in an agile environment to develop a database that will allow researchers to view this data more easily. The database allowed filters to streamline what researchers might look for and drastically decreased the time that they spent to pull the data and then analyze it as well.
